# CodeMap Explorer

## Overview

CodeMap Explorer is a Visual Studio Code extension that scans your open file, extracts function and class names, and presents them in a convenient list for swift navigation. This tool enhances your productivity by allowing you to quickly jump to any function or class within your code.

## Features

- **Function and Class Navigation**: Easily navigate to any function or class in the active file by pressing `Cmd + Alt + G` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + G` (Windows/Linux).
- **Dynamic Search Filtering**: As you type in the search box, the list updates in real-time, allowing you to find specific functions or classes quickly.
- **Collapse/Expand All**: Toggle between collapsing and expanding all functions and classes with a single click, streamlining your view of the code structure.

<!-- - **Documentation Popup**: View inline documentation or comments associated with each function or method when selected. -->

- **Jump to Definition**: Quickly jump to the definition of a selected class or function directly from the dropdown list.

<!-- - **Code Snippets**: Access commonly used code snippets for functions and classes, speeding up your coding process. -->

<!-- - **Customizable Settings**: Adjust settings such as display formats and filtering options according to your preferences. -->

<!-- - **Bookmarks for Quick Access**: Mark frequently used functions or classes as favorites for easy access later. -->
